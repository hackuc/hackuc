# HackUC 2016

Official 2016 HackUC hackathon website.

I decided to use bootstrap to create a website draft. For now, it's quite slow right now but the code can be cleaned up using chrome dev tools when I'm done, leaving a file with only css used by the html and js.

It's in a seperate branch for now, because I know Jason was scared that bootstrap would slow down the site. It should be okay, bootstrap can be easily cleaned up and also BCA uses bootstrap.
