Now, as Executive Director, I hope to bring computer science to everyone, regardless of their background. Outside of the hackathon, Iâ€™m a student teacher and spokesperson in the Taiwanese community, former intern at an e-commerce startup, class treasurer, Makerspace Executive President, FBLA Vice President of communications, but above all a tired high school student.</p>

I love kids and cats and Reese's cups, and hope to one day major in Computer Science. After going to HackBCA II, I fell in love with the idea of hackathons - passionate communities of kids making great things simply for fun. Last year, I was invited to help create the first hackathon at our school, and jumped at the chance. This year, I'm in charge of the website and other technical aspects of a hackathon, and love being a part of something amazing. </p>

I consider myself a math and science person, but I had never been able to get around to learning much about computer science. At HackUC, with very little experience in coding, my team and I were able to create our project, UCVTutors. We would not have been able to do this without the help of the mentors, especially Daniel Henriques, that worked to assist us. As Events Coordinator, I hope to help make HackUC the best event that it can be so that others, too, can have as great of a learning experience as I did.</p>

Hackathons are the perfect way for people like myself that have little exposure to computer science to branch out and try something new in a comfortable and exciting environment. I am beyond excited to be a part of the HackUC team this year and hope to bring to others the interest and excitement for computer science that HackUC brought to me.
