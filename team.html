What really draws me to hackathons is the idea that anyone of any skill level can be a part of something innovative through working as a team with others. Through collaboration in a learn-as-you-go environment, hackathons can provide a unique catalyst for computer science education while making the experience exciting and fun. My goal as a director of HackUC is to build upon last year's event while maintaining the philosophy of our organization in the process of expansion.</p>

Now, as Executive Director, I hope to bring computer science to everyone, regardless of their background. Outside of the hackathon, Iâ€™m a student teacher and spokesperson in the Taiwanese community, former intern at an e-commerce startup, class treasurer, Makerspace Executive President, FBLA Vice President of communications, but above all a tired high school student.</p>

I love kids and cats and Reese's cups, and hope to one day major in Computer Science. After going to HackBCA II, I fell in love with the idea of hackathons - passionate communities of kids making great things simply for fun. Last year, I was invited to help create the first hackathon at our school, and jumped at the chance. This year, I'm in charge of the website and other technical aspects of a hackathon, and love being a part of something amazing. </p>

I consider myself a math and science person, but I had never been able to get around to learning much about computer science. At HackUC, with very little experience in coding, my team and I were able to create our project, UCVTutors. We would not have been able to do this without the help of the mentors, especially Daniel Henriques, that worked to assist us. As Events Coordinator, I hope to help make HackUC the best event that it can be so that others, too, can have as great of a learning experience as I did.</p>

                    <p class="answer">I first heard of hackathons when some of my friends went to HackBCA and told me how much fun it was. Since then, I looked for the opportunity to participate in one and did in HackUC. I realized that even though hackathons were fun to participate in, they needed a lot of support to make them happen behind the scenes, so I started helping out with that. I am a technology intern for the UCVTS campus, and one of the founders and captains of the Westfield Robotics team. I also play Ultimate Frisbee competitively in the spring. </p>

I did not know what a Hackathon was until last year when my brother participated in HackBCA. At first I did not have any interest in Hackathons until I heard that there was a plan to have one on my campus. HackUC was my first hackathon and after experiencing such a fascinating event, I wanted to be a part of the process to help organize one.</p>

When I went to my first hackathon, I quickly learned I was wrong. I think hackathons are an important way for people to learn more about the world of computer science in a fun, open-minded environment. For this reason, I am so excited to join the HackUC team and can't wait for the event!</p>
