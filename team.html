I am involved because I believe hackathons are a excellent way to promote competency in technology, especially at the high school level. I am involved in First Robotics in the build team at the Union County Vocational Technical Schools (Team 1257) and sharpen my web development skills and apply them during my free time.</p>

                        <p class="answer">My studies at the Academy for Information Technology have taught me the importance of a solid education in the computer sciences. What really draws me to hackathons is the idea that anyone of any skill level can be a part of something innovative through working as a team with others. Through collaboration in a learn-as-you-go environment, hackathons can provide a unique catalyst for computer science education while making the experience exciting and fun. My goal as a director of HackUC is to build upon last year's event while maintaining the philosophy of our organization in the process of expansion.</p>

                    <p class="answer">I'm captain of the Science Olympiad and Math League at my school district, and in my free time I like to do freelance web development. I love kids and cats and Reese's cups, and hope to one day major in Computer Science. After going to HackBCA II, I fell in love with the idea of hackathons - passionate communities of kids making great things simply for fun. Last year, I was invited to help create the first hackathon at our school, and jumped at the chance. This year, I'm in charge of the website and other technical aspects of HackUC, and love being a part of something amazing. </p>

Even though I spent months self-studying C++ to program our robot, the most educational experience came from collaborating with my team's control systems subdivision to write the code that would bring our robot to worlds. The only experience I have ever had that mimicked the learning experience that I got when programming the robot has been HackUC. Ever since the first hackathon, I helped design our team's website, along with the website for HackUC.</p>

Additionally, I am a Safety Co-captain of the UCVTS robotics team, which attended the FIRST Championship last year. Over the summer, I interned at Stevens Institute of Technology, where I assisted graduate students in their research of nanofibers. I am also a Liberty Science Center ambassador and a volunteer at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.
