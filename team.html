                <p class="answer">I'm captain of the Science Olympiad and Math League at my school, and in my free time I like to do freelance web development. I love kids and cats and Reese's cups, and hope to one day major in Computer Science. After going to HackBCA II, I fell in love with the idea of hackathons - passionate communities of kids making great things simply for fun. Last year, I was invited to help create the first hackathon at our school, and jumped at the chance. This year, I'm in charge of the website and other technical aspects of a hackathon, and love being a part of something amazing. </p>

                <p class="answer">I first learned about hackathons a few years ago and being interested in technology, I attended my first physical hackathon, HackUC, in 2015. I am involved because I believe hackathons are a excellent way to promote competency in technology, especially at the high school level. I am involved in First Robotics in the build team at Magnet (Team 1257) and sharpen my web development skills and apply them during my free time.</p>

                <p class="answer">The entire experience of HackUC, my first hackathon, was exhilirating to be a part of since there were so many new things I could try out. Hackathons are the perfect way for people like myself that have little exposure to computer science to branch out and try something new in a comfortable and exciting environment. I am beyond excited to be a part of the HackUC team this year and hope to bring to others the interest and excitement for computer science that HackUC brought to me.

                <p class="answer">I first heard of hackathons when some of my friends went to HackBCA and told me how much fun it was. Since then, I looked for the opportunity to participate in one and did in HackUC. I realized that even though hackathons were fun to participate in, they needed a lot of support to make them happen behind the scenes, so I started helping out with that. I am a technology intern for the UCVTS campus, and one of the founders and captains of the Westfield Robotics team. I also play Ultimate Frisbee competitively in the spring. </p>

                <p class="answer">HackUC was the first hackathon I ever attended. I consider myself a math and science person, but I had never been able to get around to learning much about computer science. At HackUC, with very little experience in coding, my team and I were able to create our project, UCVTutors. We would not have been able to do this without the help of the mentors, especially Daniel Henriques, that worked to assist us. As Events Coordinator, I hope to help make HackUC the best event that it can be so that others, too, can have as great of a learning experience as I did.</p>
